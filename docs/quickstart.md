# Quick Start

This guide will help you install, configure, and start using pantry right away.

## 1. Install pantry

Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Recommended: Bun (fastest)
bun add -g @stacksjs/pantry

# Or use npm
npm install -g @stacksjs/pantry

# Or use yarn
yarn global add @stacksjs/pantry

# Or use pnpm
pnpm add -g @stacksjs/pantry
```

## 2. Bootstrap Your Environment

Let pantry set up everything you need automatically:

```bash
# One command to rule them all
pantry bootstrap

# See what's happening (recommended for first run)
pantry bootstrap --verbose
```

This command will:

- ✅ Install Bun (JavaScript runtime)
- ✅ Configure your PATH automatically
- ✅ Set up shell integration for automatic environment activation

## 3. (Optional) Set Up Shell Integration

Shell integration is installed automatically when you run `pantry bootstrap` (unless you pass `--skip-shell-integration`). If you skipped bootstrap or want to set it up manually, run:

```bash
# Add to your shell configuration (zsh)
echo 'eval "$(pantry dev:shellcode)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Or for bash users
echo 'eval "$(pantry dev:shellcode)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 4. Install Your First Package

```bash
# Install Node.js
pantry install node@22

# Verify it works
node --version
```

## 5. Create Your First Project

```bash
# Create a new project
mkdir my-first-pantry-project
cd my-first-pantry-project

# Create a dependency file
cat > dependencies.yaml << EOF
dependencies:
  - node@22
  - typescript@5.0

env:
  NODE_ENV: development
  PROJECT_NAME: my-first-project
EOF

# Environment automatically activates!
# You should see: ✅ Environment activated for /path/to/my-first-pantry-project
```

## 6. Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Check that packages are available
node --version
tsc --version

# Check environment variables
echo $NODE_ENV          # Should show: development
echo $PROJECT_NAME      # Should show: my-first-project

# List installed packages
pantry list
```
