# Introduction

> For a better developer experience.

Launchpad is a lightweight package manager built on top of [pkgx](https://pkgx.sh), designed to simplify package installation and management. It provides a clean, intuitive interface with powerful features that make working with development tools and packages easier.

## What is Launchpad?

Launchpad serves as an alternative to package managers like Homebrew, focusing on:

- A consistent and simple CLI interface
- Automatic PATH management
- Easy installation of development tools
- Cross-platform support

At its core, Launchpad leverages pkgx, a next-generation package runner that allows you to use packages without installing them. Launchpad extends this functionality with convenient commands, better management of executables, and improved integration with your development workflow.

## Key Features

- üì¶ **Package Management** _Install and manage packages directly using pkgx_
- üîÑ **Executable Shims** _Create executable shims for packages automatically_
- üõ†Ô∏è **pkgx Installation** _Install and manage the pkgx utility itself_
- üíª **Dev Environment** _Dedicated command for the dev package for development environments_
- üîß **Auto-updates** _Configure automatic updates for pkgx_
- üîå **PATH Integration** _Automatically add installation directories to your PATH_
- ü™ü **Cross-platform** _Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows systems_

## How It Works

Launchpad works by managing the installation of pkgx and creating shims (executable scripts) that automatically run the correct versions of your tools. It can:

- Install pkgx itself without requiring another package manager
- Create shims for packages so they're available system-wide
- Configure automatic updates and PATH modifications
- Simplify the installation of the `dev` package for project-specific development environments

Whether you're setting up a new development machine, working on multiple projects with different tooling requirements, or just want a cleaner way to manage your packages, Launchpad offers a streamlined experience for modern developers.

## Get Started

It's rather simple to get your package development started:

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
bunx degit stacksjs/ts-starter my-pkg
cd my-pkg

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
bun i # install all deps
bun run build # builds the library for production-ready use

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
bun run release # automates git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
```

_Check out the package.json scripts for more commands._
